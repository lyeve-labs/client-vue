# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.7] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- The package manifest carries `repository`, `homepage` and `bugs`, so the npm
  page links back to the source and the issue tracker. It published with none
  of the three, which left a reader on npm with no way back to the code.

### Changed

- The declared Node floor is 24. Continuous integration has run on Node 24 for
  some time and the manifest still said 20, which described a runtime nothing
  was tested against. Node 22 consumers are no longer within the declared
  range.
- `prepublishOnly` runs the build, so a publish cannot skip the package lint,
  the dist check or the version check. All three ran only from the build
  script before, and a bare publish uploaded whatever `dist` happened to hold.
  The version check refuses when `package.json` and the CHANGELOG head name
  different versions.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Documentation and shipped strings no longer carry em dashes, unicode
  ellipses or unicode bullets. Where a string is an error or a log line the
  wording changed and nothing else: status codes, machine-readable error codes
  and behaviour are untouched, so a client matching on a code is unaffected.
- An elision inside a code span now uses three ASCII periods, so a reader who
  copies one gets something their tool accepts.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- CONTRIBUTING documents the branch model. It covered commits and releases but never said which branch a change starts from: work branches off `dev` and the PR goes back into `dev`, while `main` takes merges and carries the release tags.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-12

### Changed

- Move to node 24 and pnpm 10.33.4.
- Build against client 0.3.0, and raise the `@lyeve-labs/client` peer floor to
  0.2.1. The previous floor allowed 0.1.x, which was never published to the registry.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Split the `types` export condition so TypeScript resolves `.d.ts` under `import` and `.d.cts` under `require`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-28

Published with no user-facing changes; repository tooling only.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- `AsyncState<T>` interface exported so consumers can type their reactive state variables.
- `useMutation` return shape changed from `[mutate, loading]` to `[mutate, { data, error, loading }]` matching React's API.
- Preserve existing data on mutation errors instead of clearing.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- Initial release.
- `CmsPlugin` - Vue plugin that provides the CMS HTTP client to the component tree via `app.use()`.
- `useClient` - composable to access the injected HTTP client from any component.
- `useQuery` - composable for async data fetching with reactive `data`, `error`, `loading` state and a `refetch` trigger.
- `useMutation` - composable for async mutations returning a `[trigger, loading]` tuple.
